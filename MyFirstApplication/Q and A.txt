Java at its basic form is a high level programming language meant to provide programmers a powerful feature set while not requiring to have to always deal with low level concepts like memory management.

Java complies at its basic level code that is designed to run on JVM regardless of operating system.

JVM is a program written for each operating system that interprets Java byte code and executes it in its current environment.

Git version control is a way for programmers to:
1. Back up code.
2. Author in a series of edits and changes.
3. Allow devs to reset and roll back code
4. Allow devs to work together and to easily edit sections of code without conflict.
